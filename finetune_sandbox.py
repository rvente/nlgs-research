# %% [markdown]
# To apply this function on all the pairs of sentences in our dataset, we just use the `map` method of our `dataset` object we created earlier. This will apply the function on all the elements of all the splits in `dataset`, so our training, validation and testing data will be preprocessed in one single command.

# %%
tokenized_datasets = raw_datasets.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

# %% [markdown]
# Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library to avoid spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.
# 
# Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fine-tuning the model

# %% [markdown]
# Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since our task is of the sequence-to-sequence kind, we use the `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us.

# %%
import torch

# %%
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq, Seq2SeqTrainingArguments, Seq2SeqTrainer
device = "cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint)
model = model.to(device)

# %% [markdown]
# Note that  we don't get a warning like in our classification example. This means we used all the weights of the pretrained model and there is no randomly initialized head in this case.

# %% [markdown]
# To instantiate a `Seq2SeqTrainer`, we will need to define three more things. The most important is the [`Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:

# %%

# %%
batch_size = 16
model_name = model_checkpoint.split("/")[-1]
args = Seq2SeqTrainingArguments(
    f"{model_name}-finetuned-xsum",
    evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_total_limit=3,
    num_train_epochs=1,
    predict_with_generate=True,
    fp16=True,
    push_to_hub=True,
)

# %% [markdown]
# Here we set the evaluation to be done at the end of each epoch, tweak the learning rate, use the `batch_size` defined at the top of the cell and customize the weight decay. Since the `Seq2SeqTrainer` will save the model regularly and our dataset is quite large, we tell it to make three saves maximum. Lastly, we use the `predict_with_generate` option (to properly generate summaries) and activate mixed precision training (to go a bit faster).
# 
# The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/t5-finetuned-xsum"` or `"huggingface/t5-finetuned-xsum"`).
# 
# Then, we need a special kind of data collator, which will not only pad the inputs to the maximum length in the batch, but also the labels:

# %%
data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, model=model)

# %% [markdown]
# The last thing to define for our `Seq2SeqTrainer` is how to compute the metrics from the predictions. We need to define a function for this, which will just use the `metric` we loaded earlier, and we have to do a bit of pre-processing to decode the predictions into texts:

# %%
import nltk
import numpy as np

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    predictions, labels = eval_pred
    decoded_preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(predictions, skip_special_tokens=True)
    # Replace -100 in the labels as we can't decode them.
    labels = np.where(labels != -100, labels, tokenizer.pad_token_id)
    decoded_labels = tokenizer.batch_decode(labels, skip_special_tokens=True)

    # Rouge expects a newline after each sentence
    decoded_preds = ["\n".join(nltk.sent_tokenize(pred.strip())) for pred in decoded_preds]
    decoded_labels = ["\n".join(nltk.sent_tokenize(label.strip())) for label in decoded_labels]

    # Note that other metrics may not have a `use_aggregator` parameter
    # and thus will return a list, computing a metric for each sentence.
    result = metric.compute(predictions=decoded_preds, references=decoded_labels, use_stemmer=True, use_aggregator=True)
    # Extract a few results
    result = {key: value * 100 for key, value in result.items()}

    # Add mean generated length
    prediction_lens = [np.count_nonzero(pred != tokenizer.pad_token_id) for pred in predictions]
    result["gen_len"] = np.mean(prediction_lens)

    return {k: round(v, 4) for k, v in result.items()}

# %% [markdown]
# Then we just need to pass all of this along with our datasets to the `Seq2SeqTrainer`:

# %%
trainer = Seq2SeqTrainer(
    model,
    args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
    data_collator=data_collator,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)

# %% [markdown]
# We can now finetune our model by just calling the `train` method:

# %%
trainer.train()

# %% [markdown]
# You can now upload the result of the training to the Hub, just execute this instruction:

# %%
# trainer.push_to_hub()

# %% [markdown]
# You can now share this model with all your friends, family, favorite pets: they can all load it with the identifier `"your-username/the-name-you-picked"` so for instance:
# 
# ```python
# from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
# 
# model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("sgugger/my-awesome-model")
# ```
